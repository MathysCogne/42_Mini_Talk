## Features

</br>
<div alignitems="center">

 
### Game Objectives (Mandatory part):

- **2D View**
- **Objective:** The player must collect all items on the map and escape via the shortest path.
- **Player Movement:** The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and never through walls.
- **Movement Counter in shell** 

### Bonus Features:

- **Random Floor Pattern:** Ground textures are randomized, and external walls differ from the labyrinth walls inside the map.
- **Character and Monster Animation:** Both the player and monsters are animated during movement.
- **Monsters:** Monsters are programmed to pursue the player at all costs. If they encounter a wall blocking their path, they will attempt to find an alternative route to reach the player.
- **Health Management:** The player has three lives before dying.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics:** The player has as many moves per turn as remaining lives + 1, while monsters always have two moves.
- **User Interface (UI):** Displays move counter, item counter, lives remaining, and a turn banner indicating if itâ€™s the playerâ€™s or monsters' turn.
